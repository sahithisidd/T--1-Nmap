#  Nmap & Wireshark Network Reconnaissance

## Objective

To perform a SYN scan on a target IP (`192.168.198.1`) and observe packet-level behavior with Wireshark. This helps in understanding:
- How open vs filtered ports behave
- What SYN packets look like in real-time
- How packet capture tools aid reconnaissance

## Tools Used

- **Kali Linux** (running inside VMware)
- **Nmap 7.95**
- **Wireshark**
